# ASP.NET Core Web API and Angular 2 Http Demo

Demonstration of using ASP.NET Core Web API features with Angular 2


## Running the Application

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

1. Navigate to the `src` folder in a command window

1. Run `npm install` to install Angular 2 dependencies

1. Run `npm run tsc:w` to compile Angular 2 TypeScript code to ES5 and watch for changes

1. Open the .sln file at the root of the project in Visual Studio.

Note: VS can install npm dependencies but I prefer to do it as a separate step.
